# QuickMart-Sales-EDA

# Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of the retail industry, supermarkets play a pivotal role in meeting the daily needs of consumers. With the advent of technology and the availability of large volumes of data, supermarkets are now in a unique position to optimize their operations and enhance the shopping experience. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a powerful approach that can provide valuable insights into supermarket sales data.

In this EDA project, we will delve into the world of QuickMart sales data between Janaury - March of 2019 to uncover patterns, trends, and opportunities that can drive informed decision-making and contribute to the supermarket's growth and success.
